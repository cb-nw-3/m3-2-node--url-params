homepage is /

- There is a page where I can view ALL of the books.//endpoint /books
  template books

  - be presented in a legible way (include the cover as well)

- I am able to get a list of books by their type. /books/:type
  template books
  - Provide the title, author and smaller version cover
  - It should look more like a list.
  - No need to add the description.
